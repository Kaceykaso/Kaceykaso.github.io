		<h2>Personal Statment</h2>
		<p>
			There are two things I love in life: making things, and making things beautiful.  My entire life, I have been creating art in one way or another; either through acrylic paint on canvas, or writing code for web applications.  In both aspects, I strive to always do things in the most efficient way possible, because efficiency is in its own right is beautiful.  And this has all led to and informed my career as a UI/UX developer.
		</p>
		<p>
 	While attending UC San Diego, I learned database programming and DOM scripting, and how the backend really does inform the front-end of web applications.  Having been under the impression that I could ignore databases as a front-end designer, I now know that much like Calculus, backend programming is something that I will use in life.  Knowing where and how the backend interacts with the user interface changes everything; and knowing when something is better off scripted on the client-side versus the server-side keeps everything efficient and beautiful.
		</p>
		<p>
It was not until my position as Web Developer for Peregrine Semiconductor that my appreciation for server-side programming would come in handy.  Redesigning and building Peregrine’s website from the ground up was the largest, and most comprehensive, test of my skills up until that point.  I knew I could build a database and use it to drive a templated web front-end, but doing that on a large scale turned out to be a different matter.  Because of the company’s existing environment, I had to make decisions not based on my expertise and comfort in a programming language, but rather what made sense for the company; and that usually meant learning new languages on the fly.  It was at Peregrine that I truly became a swiss army knife, knowing which tool was right for the job; or how to research, learn, and troubleshoot what I did not already know.
		</p>
		<p>
In my role as Professional Development Chair for Women in Computing at UC San Diego, I sharpened my management and budgeting skills.  A large component of my role was to put together a sponsorship packet, describing the organization and what it did, to use as a tool to get sponsors and donations.  WIC hosts an impressive number of events throughout the year, but none of them are possible without the help of donations from tech companies and alumni.  I learned that in doing a proper cost-benefit analysis, you can easily communicate the returns on investments to these large companies.  Once we knew our sponsors, the organization could better plan for upcoming events and serve its community efficiently.
		</p>
		<p>
In my current position as UI/UX Developer for Mitchell1, I have learned the value of being both a designer and a developer.  In most companies, the two positions are separate, on separate teams.  Being both not only gives me an edge as an individual, but it allows me to effectively communicate with both teams.  I am able to translate designer mockups into developer code, which helps me build more efficient and beautiful applications.  I can catch potential problems in mockups and raise questions ahead of time, before they cause developer issues down the line, and eventually cost time and money to fix.
		</p>
		<p>
I have learned and experienced a lot in both my academic and professional career, and being a woman in tech has not made it easy.  I am passionate about diversity of ideas in the workplace, and consider it part of my job to make that the culture where I am.  I have learned that not all work environments are equal, and some have a long way to go; but if we want to do great work then we must all be able to be different, doing what we love, free of prejudice.  And I plan to do that as beautifully and efficiently as I can.
