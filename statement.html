		<h2>Personal Statment</h2>
		<p>
			u-ni-corn [yoo-ni-kawrn] n. 1. A person who is adept at both visual design of UI and UX elements, as well as writing production code; to be both right- and left-brained.

I am a unicorn. I began my college career at The Art Institute of CA-Orange County, majoring in Animation, right after high school.  I had been reading, and drawing my own, comic books my entire life, and had decided I wanted to do nothing but that as a career.  My parents only had high school diplomas, and being the oldest of four kids, I was the first to try this thing called “college”.  I had no idea what a “for-profit university” was, or what “accredited” meant; I just knew the spokeswoman for the college was nice, and the school had “Art” right in the name.  I was meant to go there!
		</p>
		<p>
Fast forward two years, of a three year program, and I have decided I want to change majors.  People do that all the time, right? No reason why I cannot change it, except for the fact that the major I want is not one of the four offered.  I needed to go to a “real college”.  I withdraw from The Art Institute, and it is not until I try to enroll in a university that I find out that none of my credits will transfer.  Not one. I had to start all over at a junior college, as if I had not just spent 2 years in school.
Starting over was discouraging, but at least at a junior college I could take night classes, something AI did not have.  I have always had to work a full time job while going to school, but I have always made progress regardless. Despite taking on a full load of 16 units, I was still model employee at Albertsons,  being promoted time and again, and becoming the youngest Albertsons store manager in southern California.
		</p>
		<p>
It took me twice as long to get my AA from Miramar College and transfer; and it has taken me twice as long to graduate from UCSD, all while working full time.  I have had jobs in Geek Squad, IT infrastructure and applications, and software engineering; and I have usually been the only woman.  In each new position, I have had to fight, prove my worth and knowledge, and prove that I do not sleep around, more than any of my male counterparts.  Rumors would usually fly regardless, but again, I was always a model employee and promoted.  Currently, I am working in my field, working a second part time job,  all while finishing the last two classes for my bachelors degree. This June I will be the first in my family to graduate college.
		</p>
		<p>
I have learned, and began to love, programming throughout my career; snowballing from frontend web design, to backend database programming.  This all led to other, far geekier interests outside of work, like building computers, robots, and gaming.  I am equally comfortable discussing Constructivist or Bauhaus philosophy,  as I am comparing and contrasting MySQL to Oracle SQL, or SVN to Git.  I can relate how PHP being rendered on the server effects Javascript and CSS being rendered on the client side, and how cross-site scripting attacks screw all of it up.  I can translate design speak into code, bridging the gap between UI Designers and Software Engineers.
		</p>
		<p>
I am a unicorn, because I can take an idea from sketches, to wireframes and rapid prototypes, to full-stack production code.  I am unicorn, because this is very rare, and highly desired.  And it is because of this particular set of skills, that I have acquired over a long career, that I will change the world.  Because being a woman in tech has made me work harder and faster than my coworkers, and made my resolve that much more absolute.  Because I have talked in front of incoming freshmen, as a representative for my major, and heard their fears and concerns.  Because every chance I get I give back, as the Professional Development Chair for Women in Computing at UCSD, I help others in my shoes and give the advice I wish I had recieved a decade earlier.  Because I do not want the next generation of women in computing to have to suffer the rumors and hardships I did.
I want to be successful in my job, doing what I love, free of prejudice, while helping other women in my field do the same.  
I am a unicorn because I can, and will, do all of these things.  And more.
