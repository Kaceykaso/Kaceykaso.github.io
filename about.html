		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
		Currently working as a full time UI/UX Developer for Mitchell1, as well as going to school part time for a BA in Interdisciplinary Computing & the Arts at UCSD, I am also the Professional Development Co-Chair for Women in Computing at UCSD. I speak on panels to incoming freshman and transfer students on behalf of the ICAM major for the Visual Arts department several times a year, and am the Lead Python Programmer for the WalkingTools Lab at UCSD. 
		</p>
		<p>
My goal is to use skills to change the world through great front-end interface and usability design. My passion for not just creating, but creating beautifully, drives me everyday to make the world a better place. It's my belief that form and function are not just closely linked, they are inseparable. Having function without a coherent user interface is like having a car with no steering wheel or dashboard.

		<h2>My Design Principles</h2>
		<h3>Content is king.</h3>
		<p>
		Any layout should be dictated by the subject matter; the content should be the center of the universe. This applies to all areas of design and development; whether it is a website or a print ad, the message should come through loud and clear. Everything else is just window dressing.
		</p>
		<h3>Fight for the user.</h3>
		<p>
User experience is a driving force that software and hardware live and die by. Any design and/or development process should be user centric from beginning to end. If it does not benefit the user, either directly or merely just to delight, lose it.
		</p>
		<h3>Make it look good. Everywhere.</h3>
		<p>Good design accounts for all platforms, creating a consistent look and feel on any device. Software and websites alike should have a mobile strategy first, and scale up from there.</p>
		<h3>The bleeding edge.</h3>
		<p>Keeping up with technology should be a passion of any designer or developer. And this means using the latest languages, libraries, and APIs to progressively enhance whenever possible. Nothing is truly future proof, but we should strive for it anyways.</p>
