			<a href="http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/human-centered_design_considered_harmful.html">Human-Centered Design Considered Harmful</a>: an essay by Don Norman, of the Nielsen Norman Group, 2005.
		</p>
		<p>
			Is this essay, Don's major point seems to be raising questions about the new trend towards user-centered design practices, and why it might be harmful to blindly follow. While I am a firm believer in critical thinking, I have to disagree with Mr. Norman on several points in his essay.
		</p>
		<p>
		First, Mr. Norman starts out against user-centered design with what he claims as "...[two representative examples] of the most successful objects of our modern, technological worlds...", the automobile and everyday objects (I.E. kitchen utensils, gardening tools, typewriters, etc.).  He claims that despite never having actual user or A/B testing, these objects are successful, and millions of people use them with little to no trouble at all. This is only partially true: while its true the automobile never had what we now know as "user-testing" when it was first brought to market, almost all everyday objects have or do. The documentary 'Objectified' goes into great detail with several design firms on the process of designing simple objects, such as chairs or an ice cream scoop. Everything from hand-drawn mockups, to CAD drawings, to user group testing is done for almost all of them. And as for the part about millions of people using them with little to no trouble, I think the number of annual automobile deaths prove that wrong. Automobiles, while they have gotten better and smarter over the years, have never been easy to learn to use. There's a reason the current laws are in place, why teenagers have to go to driving school, and drive with a permit for six months!
		</p>
		<p>
		Mr. Norman's argument for activity-centered design is actually one I agree with, things like clocks and watches do a good job of doing their one job. But are they successful because they only do one thing? Currently, the drumbeat for smartwatches may have something to say about that. And while activity-centered design may be a good idea, I do not think it has to completely replace user-centered design. Obviously, nothing can have two centers, but can't we design products that focus on both the user and the activity/task? Both are equally important, and either one could make or break a product. The argument of being FOR activity-centered design and AGAINST user-centered design feels like being FOR function and AGAINST form. I have always held that a successful product should have both form and function. While I might be able to find a reason why a product does not NEED to have both form and function to operate, I can never find a reason why it shouldn't.
